# Metro Card Reader
Every day, New Yorkers use some kind of public transportation to get around the city. One method of payment for these public transportation is something called a 
"MetroCard" to which people would add money to a card that they can use to pay for these public transportaion. 

However, the issue arises that the customer cannot find out how much money left is within their metrocard unless they go to a train station to deliberately check their balance
on their card. 

This app only will keep track of how much money is left on the card. This app will not do anything advanced like auto balancing and most likely transfer metrocard to a new card as that would require the API which would not be supported by this app.
